## Access Status Summary

ACCESSIBLE (Open Access):
- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entries (comprehensive coverage of all three measures)

RESTRICTED (Institutional Access Required):
- Original journal papers (Analysis, The Journal of Philosophy, Philosophy of Science)
- Oxford University Press books

CONCLUSION:
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy sources provide sufficient theoretical foundation
for implementing all three coherence measures. The canonical formulas, theoretical
motivations, and implementation guidance are well-documented in these open-access sources.
Access to original papers would provide additional context but is not required for
a successful implementation.

## Formula Summary (from Accessible Sources)

### Shogenji (C2):
C₂(A,B) = P(A ∧ B) / (P(A) × P(B))
Generalized: coh(A₁,...,Aₙ) = P(A₁ ∧ ... ∧ Aₙ) / [P(A₁) × ... × P(Aₙ)]

### Glass-Olsson (C1):
C₁(A,B) = P(A ∧ B) / P(A ∨ B)
Equivalent: C₁(A,B) = P(A ∧ B) / [P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∧ B)]

### Fitelson (Confirmation-based):
General approach: Mean factual support across all subset pairs
Factual support formulas (from Kemeny & Oppenheim tradition):
  s(H,E) = P(H|E) - P(H|¬E)    [Difference measure]
  s(H,E) = P(H|E) - P(H)         [Simple confirmation]
  s(H,E) = [P(H|E) - P(H)] / [1 - P(H)]  [Normalized]

Note: Exact Fitelson formula requires accessing original 2003 paper,
but the foundational support measures are documented in accessible sources.
