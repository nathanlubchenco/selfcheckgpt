## Testing approach for research projects

This is a **research project**, not production software.

- **No Test-Driven Development**: Implement features directly without writing tests first
- **Pragmatic Validation**: Validate by running code and inspecting outputs
- **Jupyter Notebooks as Tests**: Use notebooks for interactive testing and demonstrations
- **Optional Unit Tests**: Write tests only when they provide clear experimental value
- **Focus on Functionality**: Prioritize working code over test coverage

### When tests might be useful:
- Validating mathematical implementations (coherence measures)
- Comparing output formats across different methods
- Regression testing for core detection algorithms

### Not required:
- Edge case testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Test coverage metrics
- Integration test suites
